Description: Language Server Manager for Model Context Protocol
 LSMCP is a bridge between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and
 Language Server Protocol (LSP), enabling CLI-based LLM clients
 like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to access rich code intelligence.
 .
 Features:
  - Auto-installation of LSP servers
  - Support for 24+ languages
  - 6 core MCP tools (goto_definition, find_references, hover, etc.)
  - Multi-location LSP discovery (LSMCP, Mason, system PATH)
  - Lazy initialization for performance
